        <h2>It is a simple and powerful language of general purpose</h2>
        <div id="firstly">
            <p id="first">Here are just somethings what I have done about Python until now, but if you wish to go to the official site, please go to </p>
            <a href="https://www.python.org"><b>Python.org</b></a>
            <p id="second">Personally I like it very much, especially with image processing</p>
        </div>
        <p id="cent">With Python you can achieve many of the techniques that are implemented by famous programs like Photoshop, and many other image processors, and also tricks that are used in cinematography, like fiction science scenes, and in many other applications</p>
        <p>Below you can observe one of those techniques by mix two images into only one achieved with Python</p>
        <img id="imagproc" src="images/rsz_improc_cmp.jpg" alt="improc">
        <p>Also with this language you can manage geometry with basic templates<br>
            I could create this cow on the right hand, with those templates<br>
            Moreover, there I implemented four variables<br>
            One to manage the size from<br>
            the smalllest 1 which does not appear in the image because it is too small<br>
            2 3 and 4 which do appear<br>
            and the biggest 5 that neither appears there, because there is no room enough<br>
            Another two variables to manage the position, horizontal and vertical in the page<br>
            And the last one, which is a bynary, to rotate the image to the opposite side</p>
