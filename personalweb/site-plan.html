        A short introduction about me and what I learnt at BYU-Idaho<br>
        Hello! Welcome to<br>
        I wish to help you with anything I have learned that may be useful to you<br>
        This site is intended to people who like technology and programming and also anyone who likes to know what I have done at BYU-Idaho through BYU PathWay WorldWide<br>
        I like very much to be an online student at BYU Idaho, because it is the first time I attend a Church educational institution<br>
        I like subjects and courses about programming, and to create applications for computers<br>
        I consider web design very important as it implements computer advantages to business management and almost everything, so I think it will help me to make a contribution to the world in the near future<br>
        I have been a member of the Church all my life, I like the Scriptures and Hymns, and also the declarations of leaders of the Church, especially from Pt Russell M Nelson about the joy that we experiment in life proceed from the focuss of our lives, more than the circumstances of it<br>
        I send my best wishes to all of you

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Python!
        Python is a simple and powerful language of general purpose<br>
        Somethings what I have done about Python until now<br>
        Personally I like it very much, especially with image processing<br>
        With Python you can achieve many of the techniques that are implemented by famous programs like Photoshop and many other image processors, and also tricks that are used in cinematography like fiction science scenes and many other applications<br>
        Here you can observe one of those techniques by mix two images into only one achieved with Python<br>
        Also with this language you can manage geometry with basic one templates. I could create this cow with those templates<br>
        Moreover, there I implemented four variables<br>
        One to manage the size from the smalllest 1 which does not appear in the image becuse it is too small, 2 3 and 4 that do appear, and the biggest 5 that also does not appear there, because there is no room enough<br>
        Another two variables to manage the position horizontal and vertical in the page<br>
        And the last one, which is a bynary, to rotate the image to the opposite sense<br>
        Personally, I feel very glad with my cow, thanks to Python

      <h3>HTML&CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my WDD130 Web Projects!<br>
        What I have done about HTML and CSS until now<br>
        I like very much to be an online student at BYU Idaho, because it is the first time I attend a Church educational institution -> About BYU-I<br>
        It is important in web design to know about HTML language and also the CSS one, which let us work making nice and functional web pages -> HTML Layouts Elements<br>
        This was my first Web page at the course, just HTML alone -> About Me Page<br>
        This was ours first commercial project about a Rafting Club, web site -> White Water Rafting Website<br>
        The site plan, that details how the website is constructed, its purpose, and other features -> White Water Rafting Siteplan<br>
        This page was only intended to help us fix coding errors -> Troubleshooting<br>
        Gridding is an important subject in CSS to positioning HTML elements -> Positioning Activity<br>
        A little example of Gridding -> Tart & Sweet<br>
        Another one-> City Scape<br>
        We also learn about several jobs and careers related to making web sites -> Web Designer<br>
        As you already see, this is our personal web site -> Personal Website<br>
        And its site plan -> Personal Siteplan<br>
        I have been a member of the Church all my life, I like the Scriptures and Hymns, and also the declarations of leaders of the Church, especially from Pt Russell M Nelson about the joy that we experiment in life proceed from the focuss of our lives, more than the circumstances of it -> Pt Russell M. Nelson<br>
