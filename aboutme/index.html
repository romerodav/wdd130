    <!--<h2>I am David Romero</h2>-->
    <h4> About Me Dav:</h4>
    <p>I like subjects and courses about programming, economy and business</p>
    <p>I like to create applications for computers</p>
    <!--<p>Also to watch music videos, soccer games, and some movies. Also I like to play tennis and tennis table</p>
    <p>Currently I am employed as an administrative assistant</p>-->
    <p>I like very much to be an online student at BYU Idaho, because it is the first time I attend a Church educational institution</p>
    <p>I consider web design very important as it implements computer advantages to business management and almost everything, so I think it will help me to make a contribution to the world in the near future</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church all my life, I like the Scriptures and Hymns, and also the declarations of leaders of the Church, especially from Pt Russell M Nelson about the joy that we experiment in life proceed from the focuss of our lives, more than the circumstances of it</p>
    <p>I send my best wishes to all of you</p>
